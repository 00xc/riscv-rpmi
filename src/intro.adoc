== Introduction
This document describes the RISC-V Platform Management Interface (RPMI), which is
an extensible interface to manage and control the system using a dedicated microcontroller. Systems today pose challenges in terms of manageability and controllability where the OS may have to support a variety of hardware which
can be different in design and connected devices. The extra complexity and
demand to manage and control the system along with executing compute workloads
is challenging for the Application Processors running the OS. To mitigate this,
systems today contain one or more Platform Microcontrollers which abstract 
various platform specific system management and control related tasks. 
RPMI enables the communication between the application processors and the 
Platform micro-controllers. It abstracts the system complexity and provides a message-based interface for system management and control.

RPMI is not limited to a single Application Processor and Platform 
Microcontroller. It can support multiple Application Processors and multiple Platform Microcontrollers.

The Platform Micro-Controller (PuC)  serves as an external embedded processor 
that abstracts low-level platform control management from the application 
processor system. This design allows RPMI to provide an OS-agnostic, generic interface that can support various System-on-Chip (SoC) hardware or platforms.

Furthermore, RPMI offers a scalable and extensible interface that can support 
the addition of new service groups over time, allowing for the implementation 
of new features and functions. This feature simplifies the integration of new components and technologies into existing systems, making it easier for system designers to keep up with changing requirements and adapt to evolving industry standards.



=== Abstractions provided by RPMI
*Transport*: Describes the mechanism by which the messages are exchanged 
between the Application Processors and Platform Microcontrollers. 

*Messaging Protocol*: Provides the Messaging Interface between the Application
Processors and Platform Microcontrollers to communicate with each other via 
messages to make requests for various services supported by the hardware 
platform. This is accomplished by grouping each management interface into 
service groups. With each service group implementing several individual 
services within.

RPMI currently provides message interfaces to manage power, voltage, 
performance, idle states etc, along with extensibility for vendors to add their 
own interfaces.

Application Processor and A.P are used interchangeably throughout this document.
Similarly, Platform Microcontroller and PuC are used interchangeably.

.High Level Architecture

An RPMI agent is an implementation instance of the RPMI Messaging Protocol and Transport. It is necessary to implement the AP side RPMI agent for most RPMI services in M-mode. While it may be possible to implement the AP side RPMI
agent in S-mode for some RPMI services, an M-mode RPMI agent also enhances 
security.

.Transport for M-Mode and S-Mode

RPMI is designed to work with a single or multi-tenant topology as depicted
above.

NOTE: The discovery of the transport itself is out of scope for this document. Which can either be described in firmware through DT cite:[DT] or ACPI cite:[ACPI].
