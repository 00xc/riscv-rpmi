== Introduction
This document describes the RISC-V Platform Management Interface (RPMI), which
provides an extensible interface to manage and control the system using a 
dedicated microcontroller. 

Today's systems pose challenges in terms of manageability and controllability
where the operating system may need to support a variety of hardware that can be
of different designs and with variety of connected devices. The extra complexity
and demand to manage and control the system along with executing compute
workloads is a challenge for the application processors running the OS. To
mitigate this, systems today contain one or more platform microcontrollers
that abstract various platform specific system management and control related
tasks. RPMI enables the communication between the application processors and the
platform microcontrollers. It abstracts the system complexity and provides a
message-based interface for system management and control.

RPMI is not limited to a single application processor and platform
microcontroller. It can support multiple application processors and multiple
platform microcontrollers.

The platform microcontroller or in short PuC abstracts low-level platform
control and management from the application processor.

In addition, RPMI provides a OS-agnostic scalable and extensible interface that
can support the addition of new capabilities and services over time. This
feature simplifies the integration of new components and technologies into
existing systems, making it easier for system designers to keep up with changing
requirements and adapt to evolving industry standards.

=== Abstractions provided by RPMI
*Transport*: Describes the mechanism by which the messages are exchanged
between the application processor and the platform microcontroller.

*Messaging Protocol*: Provides the messaging interface between the application
processors and the platform microcontrollers to communicate with each other via
messages to make requests for various services supported by the hardware
platform. This is accomplished by grouping each management interface into
service groups. With each service group implementing several individual
services within.

In addition to the standard services, RPMI can also be extended to allow vendors
to add their own services.

RPMI is designed to work with a single or multi-tenant topology as shown
below.

==== RPMI Client
An RPMI client is a software or a driver which is capable of sending and
receiving RPMI messages.

==== RPMI Context
An RPMI context consists of an RPMI transport instance with RPMI message protocol
layer. Each RPMI context has a mandatory BASE service group enabled along with
one or more optional service groups. 

An RPMI context is specific to a RISC-V privilege level in an application
processor. An RPMI context must only be accessible at a given privilege level.
Each service group in RPMI defines the privilege level at which it can be accessed.
An RPMI context must only enable service group which are allowed as per the
service group privilege level requirement.
