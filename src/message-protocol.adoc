== Message Protocol
The RPMI protocol defines the message format and different messages
for system management and control tasks. Each message is called a *Service*
designated to perform a specific task. Multiple similar services are grouped
logically into a *Service Group* like Clock, Voltage, Power management, etc.
A service call results in a request message being sent on a transport
channel from the application processor to the platform microcontroller or
vice-versa. If the request has an associated response, the platform
microcontroller after processing and servicing the request can send the
response message with status and additional data.

=== Message Types
There are three categories of messages supported - *Request*, *Acknowledgement*
and *Notification*.

==== REQUEST
Message that convey a command is called a request message. Each command is
associated with an action which the platform microcontroller will take and may
acknowledge the application processor with a response message if supported by
that request message. The response message will carry status code and
additional data if required.

Not every request message needs an acknowledgement due to the nature of the
action requested by the application processor that may leave the application
processor in a state where it cannot receive the acknowledgment. For example,
when the application processor requests the platform microcontroller to
suspend the system or reset the application processor itself.

Request messages based on the acknowledgement are further categorized as -

===== Normal Requests
Request message with Acknowledgement.

===== Posted Requests
Request message without Acknowledgement

==== ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Acknowledgement is a message which carries the status of the request message
after it has been processed successfully. The acknowledgement messages may
also carry additional data depending on the service.

==== NOTIFICATION
Notification is a message sent asynchronously from the platform
microcontroller to the application processor to notify about the events
happened in the system related to various service groups.

=== Message Format
Each message regardless of its type consists of two parts - Message Header
and Data. The size of the message header is fixed, but the data size is
implementation-defined, based on the layout of transport queues. All the
messages must follow the byte order as defined by the RPMI transport.

==== Message Layout Tables
The message layout which includes header and data is represented in the form
of tables as shown below. Some of the columns listed below may be omitted from
some of the tables as required.

.Message Layout Table Example
[cols="4, 3, 3, 3", width=100%, align="center", options="header"]
|===
| Word
| Name
| Type
| Description

| Each message is split into multiple *Words* where each word is of `4-byte`
and indexed starting from `0`. This column represents the index of that word.
| Name of the word. Name may be omitted if not required.
| Type of field, eg: int32 or uint32, etc
| Description and interpretation of the fields present in the word.
|===

==== Message Header
The message header of `8-byte` has a fixed layout that consists of multiple
fields. Each message gets a unique identity in an RPMI instance through its
header.

`SERVICE_ID` to match the request message with its corresponding
acknowledgement message.

Stores the size of the message data in bytes. Value stored in this field must
be multiple of `4-byte` or `0` if no data is present.
!===
|===

In case of normal request messages which require acknowledgement, the
platform microcontroller must preserve the `TOKEN`, `SERVICEGROUP_ID`,
`SERVICE_ID` from the normal request message header and use these fields in the
acknowledgement message header. The platform microcontroller must mark the
message type as `ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` in the `FLAGS` and update the `DATALEN`
depending on the data supported by that acknowledgement.
In case of notification, the platform microcontroller will generate the `TOKEN`
and set the `SERVICEGROUP_ID` and fixed `SERVICE_ID=0x00` assigned for each
notification message in each service group and set the 
`FLAGS` with message type as `NOTIFICATION`. The notification messages do not 
require any acknowledgement.

==== Message Data
Message data in any message type if present must be multiple of `4-byte`.
Data format for the request and acknowledgement messages depends on each 
service and details are present with each service section in their 
respective service groups. The maximum size of data each message can
accommodate depends on the transport `slot-size` attribute. Services where the
data exceeds the size that a single message can accommodate, multipart messages
can be used. Some request messages may not have associated data and in that
case their `DATALEN` field in the message must be `0`.

The acknowledgement message data must contain a `32-bit` `STATUS` code which
represents the error code generated during the servicing of the request message.
The acknowledgement message may contain more data apart from the `STATUS` code
depending on the corresponding request message. The minimum `DATALEN` value for
the acknowledgement message is `4-byte` for `STATUS` code. The acknowledgement
message must not return partial data apart from `STATUS` code if supported.

=== Notifications
Notification messages are asynchronous messages that notify about the events
that occurred in the system. A notification message is a posted message which
does not require an acknowledgement. A notification message may combine
multiple events into a single message depending on the available space in the
message data. Individual events may also have additional data associated with
them. Any action required on behalf of any event notification is dependent on
the application processor. <<img-notification-format>> shows the notification
message format.

Each service group has a service of type notification with a fixed 
`SERVICE_ID=0x00` used to send the events in the notification message.
By default the event notification is disabled for each service
group and the application processor must subscribe to the supported events in
each service group to receive notification messages. Notification messages are
only sent for events to which the application processor has subscribed to. If
multiple events are supported in each service group, the application processor
must subscribe to each event individually through reserved
`ENABLE_NOTIFICATION` service in each service group. 

[#img-notification-format]
.Notification Format
image::notification-format.png[500,600]

==== Events
An event consists of a header containing two fields: `EVENT_ID (8-bit)`
and `EVENT_DATALEN (16-bit)`.
An event may also have associated data. If the event data is present, it must
be a multiple of `4-byte`.

The number of events that can be stored in a notification message depends upon
the maximum message data size. The `DATALEN` field in the message header 
represents the data size in bytes present in the message which is the aggregate
of all event sizes. The application processor must parse each event and
its data according to the event header.

Event data and its format is specific to a service group and details are
given in the respective service group sections.
