== Message Protocol
Message Protocol supports a variety of system management and control tasks and 
provides a message interface for such tasks. Each message which does a specific 
task is called Service. Multiple messages or Services are grouped into Service 
Groups like Clock, Voltage, Power management, etc. A service call results in a 
message request being sent to the Platform micro-controller for a specific 
purpose. Each service may have an associated response message which enables the 
Platform micro-controller to provide the status or information for that request.

=== Message Types
A message can either be a request or an acknowledgement in response to a request
received by an client.

==== REQUEST
Messages which convey a command to the other entity/client, usually from the AP 
from either S-Mode/M-mode client to Platform Microcontroller (it may also send 
REQUESTs to AP, but there are no use cases yet). Each command will have a 
certain action that the Platform Microcontroller will take and it may 
acknowledge the AP with another message in return which may contain some data or
just the status code.

Not every request needs to be acknowledged because the action taken by the 
Platform Microcontroller may leave the AP in a state where it is not able to 
wait for the acknowledgment. For example, in the case when the AP asks the 
Platform Microcontroller to perform a Reset, where an acknowledgment would not 
be meaningful.

* *Normal Requests*: Requests with Acknowledgement
* *Posted Requests*: Requests without Acknowledgement

==== ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
Messages sent from Platform Microcontroller to AP (or vice-versa) in a response 
to any previous message request. Acknowledgment is dependent on the service and 
each service dictates if acknowledgment is mandatory or not.

==== NOTIFICATIONS
Notifications are messages which are sent asynchronously from PuC to AP to 
notify about the events happening in the system related to various service 
groups. Notifications are covered in detail in below section <<ADD LINK HERE>>

=== Message Format
On the AP side, each call to a service results in a message request to the PuC. 
The type of message depends upon the type of service and to which group that 
particular service belongs. Each message, whether its Request or 
Acknowledgement,  consists of two main parts - Message Header and Data.

Size of message header is fixed, but size of data is implementation defined, 
based on the transport queues layout.  All fields in the request and 
acknowledgment must follow byte ordering defined by the RPMI transport.

==== Message Header
Message header has a fixed size of `12-byte` which further contains three 
fields each of `4-byte`. Each message gets a unique identity in a RPMI instance
through its header.

Both REQUEST and ACKNOWLEDGEMENT messages have the same message format.

In case of Notifications, `SERVICE_ID` and `MESSAGE_TYPE` for notification 
messages are fixed which will contribute to the unique identity of the message 
in that RPMI instance implementation.

! *[7:0]* ! *SERVICE_ID* +
`8-bit` identifier from LSB in the message identifier word, Services are the 
functions which, when called, result in different message requests for different control and management tasks meant for Platform Microcontroller. Each service is identified by a `SERVICE_ID`
!===
| 3	| *DATALEN*		| Encodes the size of the data in the message, data will also be in `32-bit` chunks. 
If there is no data, then it must be initialized to zero. 
|===

Once a message request has been serviced and that service is of type Normal 
Request which requires an acknowledgement, PuC must preserve the `TOKEN`, 
`SERVICEGROUP_ID`, `SERVICE_ID` from the normal request message header and use 
these fields in acknowledgement message header. PuC must mark the message type 
in the `FLAGS` and also according to the data expected in the acknowledgement it
may change `DATALEN` in the message header. In case of notifications, PuC will 
generate the `TOKEN` and set the `SERVICEGROUP_ID` and fixed `SERVICE_ID=0x00` 
assigned for each notification message in every service group and set the 
`FLAGS` with notification `MESSAGE_TYPE` marked. Notification messages do not 
require any acknowledgement and how data from notification messages is utilized 
is dependent on the implementation.

==== Message Data
Request message data format and acknowledgement data format depends on each 
service and details are present with each service section below in their 
respective service groups. Size of data each message can accommodate depends on 
the transport queues slot size. This specification already defines the data 
layout for each size. For few services where the data exceeds the size which a 
single message can accommodate, multipart messages are used.

Message data formats in this specification are tabulated with a list of `32-bit` 
wide Word in each of the service groups section as depicted below.

| Word index in message DATA field | Name of field | Type of field, eg: int32 or uint32, etc | Description and interpretation of field
|===

The data in acknowledgment at least should contain a `32-bit` `STATUS` code. 
Apart from status code, an acknowledgement may encode more data as response to 
the request message and details are subsequently present in each service section 
below.


=== Notifications
Notifications are the messages from Platform Microcontroller to Application 
Processor to notify about events taking place in the system. Notifications are 
posted messages which do not require acknowledgement from the recipient. Events 
can include the system states, power states, errors/faults in the system etc. 
Action taken on behalf of any event notification is completely dependent on the 
AP and they can be ignored. Platform Microcontroller may combine multiple events
into a single message depending on the available space in the message data. 
Individual events may also have additional data associated. _Figure 3.4_ shows 
the notification message format.

Each service group will have a notification service with fixed `SERVICE_ID=0x00`
across every service group. Notifications are sent from PuC to AP with events 
and associated data if any. AP has to subscribe to the supported events in each 
service group to receive these notification messages. A notification message may
have one or more events with their associated data. 
This service with `SERVICE_ID=0x00` is reserved in each service group even if 
the service group does not support notifications or need to support any events. 
These notifications will only be sent for those events only for which the AP 
subscribes. When there are multiple events supported in each service group, AP 
has to subscribe to each event and has to make multiple calls to notification 
enable service. 

Notifications enable service is also present in each service group even if that 
service group does not support notifications or implement any event support.

Every event will have an Event Header which consists of two fields to identify 
an event - `EVENT_ID (12-bit)` and `EVENT_DATALEN (20-bit)`. Events may have 
data associated, if present, must be multiple of 4 bytes. 

The number of events which can be accommodated in the message data depends on 
the message data field size. The `DATALEN` field in the message header will 
encode how much size data is present in the message which is the aggregate of 
all events. Then AP must parse each event and its data according to the Event 
header.

Event data and its format depend on the service group and details are present in
respective service group sections.

Above table represents the format for one event with its data. Subsequent events
will be packed in the same manner. This spec does not define any ordering of 
packing of multiple events and its implementation defined.

=== Return Status Codes
Below table lists all the error codes which can be returned by any service. Few 
probable error codes for each service are also provided in each service response
message format. AP must check for each error code and action based on that is 
dependent on the AP.
