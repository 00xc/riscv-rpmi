== Message Protocol
The RPMI protocol defines the message format and different messages
for system management and control tasks. A message is called a Service if its
designated to perform a specific task. Multiple similar services are grouped
logically into a Service Group like Clock, Voltage, Performance, etc.
A service call results in a request message being sent on a transport
channel from the application processor to the platform microcontroller or
vice-versa. If the request has an associated response, the platform
microcontroller after processing and servicing the request can send the
response message with status and additional data.

=== Message Types
Three categories of message are supported - REQUEST, ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
and NOTIFICATION.

A Request message represents a specific control and management task which needs
to be performed. A Request message represents a service in RPMI. Depending on
the services defined, a request message may also carry data if required by a
service. Not all request messages have an associated response message also
called an acknowledgement. For example the request for system reset from the
application processor to the platform microcontroller does not require a
response message. If a request message has an associated acknowledgement message
then it is called a NORMAL REQUEST otherwise it is called a POSTED REQUEST.

The Acknowledgement message indicates the status of the request message after it
has been processed by the platform microcontroller.
The acknowledgement messages may also contain additional data depending on the
defined service.

A Notification is an asynchronous message from the platform microcontroller to
the application processor to inform it about the events that have occurred in
the system.

=== Message Format
Each message regardless of its type consists of two parts - message header
and data. The size of the message header is fixed, but the size of the data
is implementation-defined, based on the layout of the transport queues. All the
messages must follow the byte order as defined by the RPMI transport.

==== Message Layout Tables
The message layout, including header and data, is presented in the form
of tables as shown below. Some of the columns listed below may be omitted from
some of the tables if required.

| This column represents the index of that word. +
Each message is split into several *Words*, where each word is `4-byte` long
and indexed starting from `0`.

| Type of field, eg: int32 or uint32, etc
| Description and interpretation of the fields present in the word.

==== Message Header
The `8-byte` message header has a fixed layout consisting of several fields.
Each message is given a unique identity in an RPMI instance by its header.

unique within a given service group.

! [15:0]

`SERVICE_ID` to associate the request message with its corresponding
acknowledgement message.

! DATALEN +
Stores the size of the message data in bytes. The value stored in this field must
be a multiple of `4-byte` or `0` if no data is present.
!===
|===

In the case of normal request messages requiring acknowledgement, the
platform microcontroller must preserve the `TOKEN`, `SERVICEGROUP_ID` and
`SERVICE_ID` fields from the normal request message header and use these fields
in the acknowledgement message header. The platform microcontroller must mark
the message type as `ACKNOWLEDGEMENT` in the `FLAGS` and update the `DATALEN`
according to the data carried by this acknowledgement.

In the case of notification message, the platform microcontroller will generate
the `TOKEN` and set the `SERVICEGROUP_ID` and the fixed `SERVICE_ID=0x00`
assigned to the notification message type in each service group and set the
`FLAGS` with the message type as `NOTIFICATION`. The notification messages do not
require an acknowledgement.

==== Message Data
Message data in a message of any type if present must be a multiple of `4-byte`.
The data format for the request and acknowledgement messages depends on the
individual service and details are defined in every service's section in their
respective service group. The maximum size of data each message can
accommodate depends on the transport `slot-size` attribute. Services where the
data exceeds the size that a single message can accommodate, multipart messages
can be used. Some request messages may not have associated data and in that
case their `DATALEN` field in the message must be `0`.

The acknowledgement message data contains a 32-bit `STATUS` code which
represents the error code.
The acknowledgement message may contain other data in addition to the `STATUS`
code depending on the corresponding request message.

=== Notifications
Notification messages are asynchronous messages that notify about the events
that have occurred in the system. A notification message has no associated
acknowledgement. A notification message can combine multiple events into a
single message depending on the space available in the message data. Individual
events may also have additional data associated with them. Any action required
on behalf of an event depends on the application processor.
<<img-notification-format>> shows the notification message format.

Each service group has one service with a fixed `SERVICE_ID=0x01` to subscribe
to events. By default the event notification is disabled for each service
group and the application processor must subscribe to the supported events in
each service group to receive notification messages. Notification messages are
only sent for events to which the application processor has subscribed to. If
multiple events are supported in each service group, the application processor
must subscribe to each event individually using reserved `ENABLE_NOTIFICATION`
service in every service group.

[#img-notification-format]
.Notification Message Format
image::notification-format.png[500,600, align="center"]

==== Events
An event consists of a header containing two fields: `EVENT_ID (8-bit)`
and `EVENT_DATALEN (16-bit)`.
An event may also have associated data. If the event data is present, it must
be a multiple of `4-byte`.

The number of events that can be stored in a notification message depends on
the maximum message data size. The `DATALEN` field in the message header
represents the data size in bytes present in the message which is the aggregate
of all event sizes. The application processor must parse each event and
its data according to the event header.

The event data and its format is specific to a service group and details are
given in the respective service group sections.

=== Return Error Codes
The following table lists all the error codes that can be returned by a service
in the `STATUS` field of the acknowledgement message. The `STATUS` field returns
`0` on success otherwise a negative 32-bit integer to indicate a error
condition.
