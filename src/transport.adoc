== Transport
RPMI Transport is the abstraction over a physical medium used to send and 
receive messages between an Application Processor and Platform Microcontroller 
enabling bidirectional communication. 

A RPMI transport instance provides a bidirectional communication channel between
a privilege level of a set of APs and one PuC. There can be multiple RPMI 
transport instances between a set of  APs and one PuC. For example: there can 
be a separate transport instance between each privilege level of APs and one 
PuC. A platform can also have multiple PuCs with each having its own set of 
RPMI transport to communicate with APs. The _Figure 1.2_ above shows different 
topologies of RPMI transport.

The physical medium of a RPMI transport can be shared memory or I2C or SPI or 
some other medium. This specification only defines a shared memory based RPMI 
transport but a platform can define its own RPMI transport.

RISC-V S-Mode/M-Mode clients are responsible for the packing of the messages as 
per the message binary format requirements described later and sharing the 
message via the transport layer. The transport layer abstracts the mechanism of 
how the message is physically delivered between Application Processor and 
Platform Microcontroller or vice versa.

=== Doorbell Interrupt
A RPMI transport may also provide doorbell interrupts for either Application 
Processors or Platform Microcontrollers or both to signal new messages. 
The doorbell mechanism is optional for a RPMI transport and implementations can
 always use a polling mechanism for checking the arrival of messages. 

The doorbell interrupt from APs to PuC can be a MSI or a wired interrupt with a 
RPMI transport specific way to trigger the interrupt.

The doorbell interrupt from PuC to APs can be either a wired interrupt or 
message signaled interrupt (MSI). If the doorbell interrupt from PuC to APs is 
a wired interrupt then RPMI transport must define a way to trigger the 
interrupt. If the doorbell interrupt from PuC to APs is a MSI then RPMI messages
can be used by APs to configure the MSI.

=== Shared Memory Transport
The physical memory of the RPMI shared memory transport can be either a device 
memory or dedicated SRAM or some portion of DRAM. The RPMI shared memory 
transport does not specify where the shared memory resides, but it should be 
accessible from both Application Processor and Platform Microcontroller and 
all necessary configuration needs to be done to make sure that side effects 
related to caching or anything else do not happen.

NOTE: To avoid the caching side effects, the platform can configure the shared 
memory as IO or non-cacheable memory for both APs and PuC.

All data sent/received through RPMI shared memory MUST follow Little-Endian byte
 ordering, unless, optionally, the byte-ordering is discovered during the 
transport discovery phase.

The doorbell interrupt from APs to PuC is optional for RPMI shared memory 
transport and if available then it MUST be supported through a read-modify-write
sequence to a memory mapped register. This read-modify-write mechanism can be 
discovered by APs via DT or ACPI using properties such as register physical 
address, mask, and value.

The doorbell interrupt from PuC to APs for RPMI shared memory transport is 
platform specific.

The subsequent sections describe the layout and attributes of shared memory 
which should be consistent across both Application Processor and Platform 
Microcontroller. These attributes can be static for the Platform Microcontroller
and discoverable via DT or ACPI for the Application Processor. 


==== Attributes of Shared Memory
* `BASE_ADDRESS`: Aligned to `4096 bytes`
* `SIZE`: Aligned to `4096 bytes`
* `SLOT_SIZE`: `>=` 64 bytes

```
N bytes : Total Shared Memory Size
M = (N/4) bytes : Single Queue Shared Memory Size
(M-8)/SLOT_SIZE : No. of Slots in Single Queue

where SLOT_SIZE >= Maximum Message Size
and
8 = No. of Bytes for Head + Tail Slots
```

==== Layout of Shared Memory
The shared memory RPMI Transport defines four shared memory based queues for 
bidirectional synchronous/asynchronous communication between an AP and PuC. 
The detailed layout of shared memory and queues is shown in Figure 2.1. All 
queues in shared memory are contiguous and of equal size. Sequence of queues is 
arranged such that queues which enable Request-Acknowledgement for a side either
AP to PuC or vice versa are together.

==== Shared Memory Queues
===== AP to PuC Request (*A2P REQ*)
This queue is to transmit REQUEST messages from AP to PuC.

===== PuC to AP Acknowledgement (*P2A ACK*)
This queue is to transmit the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT messages from PuC to AP for the 
request messages received by PuC on A2P REQ Queue.

===== PuC to AP Request (*P2A REQ*)
This queue is to transmit REQUEST messages from PuC to AP.

===== AP to PuC Acknowledgement (*A2P ACK*)
This queue is to transmit the ACKNOWLEDGEMENT messages from AP to PuC for the 
request messages received by the AP on P2A REQ Queue.

.Transport Architecture

Each queue contains *M* number of slots and each slot stores a single message. 
Slot size must be sufficient to store the biggest message in the framework. 
Shared memory also contains the head and tail for the enqueuing and dequeuing 
of the messages for each queue. The RPMI specification expects a minimum size of
`64 bytes` for each slot but bigger slots may also work depending on the 
implementation.

.Queue Internals
image::queue-internals.png[900,900]

Slots can be accessed using head and tail which will store the indices. 
Head will be used to dequeue the message and Tail will enqueue. 

Head and Tail will be owned and incremented by only a single entity depending on
the role of that entity, whether that entity is enqueuing or dequeuing. 
For example, on the A2P channel, Application Processor will enqueue the message 
so it will own and increment the Tail, similarly, Platform Microcontroller will 
own the head to dequeue the messages and only Platform Microcontroller will 
increment the head.  

Once the reader dequeues a message from the slot, it has to mark that slot to be
usable by the writer to enqueue further messages into that slot. Message header 
flags are used to mark a message as invalid which makes that slot free to use. 

Like a normal circular queue, it can either be empty, full or have valid 
messages. Enqueue operation will check if the queue is not full by checking if 
the head is equal to the tail and the slot referenced by the current tail has a 
valid message. Similarly, the dequeue operation will check for the empty state 
by validating if the slot referenced by the current head has an invalid message.

Messages which are not consumed yet should not be overwritten and the sender 
must block until the slot is available for the sending messages.
